# Time Agent: Single Developer Focus

This document provides strategies and recommendations for developing Time Agent as a solo developer, focusing on maintainable architecture, effective time management, and prioritizing features for maximum value.

## Development Philosophy

As a solo developer, your approach should prioritize:

1. **Sustainable pace**: Build incrementally without burnout
2. **Value delivery**: Focus on features that provide immediate utility
3. **Automation**: Use tools that reduce manual work
4. **Simplicity**: Favor straightforward solutions over complex architectures
5. **Type safety**: Leverage TypeScript and tRPC to catch errors early

## Tech Stack Rationale

The recommended tech stack has been carefully chosen to minimize maintenance overhead while maximizing developer productivity:

| Technology | Why It's Solo-Developer Friendly |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Next.js 15 | Built-in API routes reduce need for separate backend |
| Supabase | Managed database with built-in auth (less infrastructure to maintain) |
| tRPC | End-to-end type safety without manual type maintenance |
| Tailwind + shadcn/ui | Copy-paste components reduce UI development time |
| Vercel | Zero-config deployments with built-in CI/CD |
| TypeScript | Catch errors early during development |
| TanStack Query | Simplified data fetching with caching |

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Application (3-4 weeks)

Focus on building a minimal but useful product:

1. **Database and authentication** (Week 1)
   - Set up Supabase project
   - Configure authentication 
   - Implement basic user profiles

2. **API layer with tRPC** (Week 1-2)
   - Set up tRPC server and client
   - Create core procedures for activities and projects
   - Implement authentication middleware

3. **Manual time tracking** (Week 2)
   - Create time entry form
   - Build project/category management
   - Implement basic dashboard

4. **Simple reports** (Week 3)
   - Daily/weekly views
   - Basic filtering
   - CSV export

5. **GitHub OAuth** (Week 4)
   - Basic GitHub integration
   - User profile from GitHub
   - Repository listing

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal**: Have a usable, manual time tracking application that you can actually use yourself.

### Phase 2: First Extension (2-3 weeks)

Build your first extension to start collecting data automatically:

1. **VSCode extension** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Project file activity tracking
   - Idle detection
   - Local storage for offline operation
   - tRPC client integration

2. **API integration** (Week 3)
   - Endpoints for activity submission
   - Batch processing
   - Sync mechanism

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal**: Get automated tracking working in one environment.

### Phase 3: AI Enhancement (2-3 weeks)

Add intelligence to the collected data:

1. **Data processing pipeline** (Week 1)
   - Basic activity categorization
   - Context extraction

2. **OpenAI integration** (Week 2)
   - Activity classification
   - Summary generation

3. **Enhanced reporting** (Week 3)
   - AI-generated summaries
   - Activity categorization
   - Time insights

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal**: Make the data more valuable through AI-powered analysis.

## Sustainability Strategies

### Time Management

- **Time-box development sessions**: 2-3 hour focused sessions with breaks
- **Weekly planning**: Set 2-3 key objectives per week
- **Dog-fooding**: Use Time Agent to track development of Time Agent itself

### Testing Approach

For a solo developer, a pragmatic testing strategy is crucial:

1. **Critical paths**: Focus tests on authentication, data processing, and API endpoints
2. **Type safety**: Leverage tRPC and TypeScript to reduce runtime errors
3. **UI testing**: Minimal UI testing, focus on core user flows
4. **Extension testing**: Manual testing for extensions initially

### Technical Debt Management

- **Weekly refactor sessions**: Schedule dedicated time for cleanup
- **Incremental improvements**: Small enhancements during feature development
- **Clear TODO comments**: Document shortcuts for future improvement
- **Type-driven development**: Use tRPC and TypeScript to maintain API consistency

## Simplification Opportunities

Areas where you can simplify without compromising core value:

1. **Start with limited integrations**
   - Begin with GitHub only, add others later
   - Use webhooks instead of building a complete API client

2. **Focus on one client extension first**
   - Complete VSCode extension before starting others
   - Use learnings to streamline development of other extensions

3. **Streamline UI development**
   - Start with a simple dashboard
   - Use pre-built components from shadcn/ui
   - Prioritize functionality over design initially

4. **Database simplification**
   - Start with a minimal schema
   - Rely on Supabase for authentication and storage
   - Add indexes and optimizations only when needed

5. **API development**
   - Use tRPC to define procedures incrementally
   - Start with core CRUD operations
   - Add more complex procedures as needed

## Development Tools and Automation

Leverage these tools to increase your productivity:

1. **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion and pair programming
2. **Continuous Deployment**: Set up Vercel for automatic deploys
3. **Database Migrations**: Use Supabase migrations for schema changes
4. **Error Monitoring**: Implement basic logging with Vercel analytics
5. **Release Management**: Semantic versioning with GitHub releases
6. **Type Safety**: tRPC for end-to-end type safety

## Personal Development Flow

A suggested daily/weekly workflow:

1. **Monday**: Plan the week, set objectives
2. **Tuesday-Thursday**: Core development
3. **Friday**: Testing, documentation, and review
4. **Bi-weekly**: Refactoring sessions
5. **Monthly**: Architecture review and roadmap adjustment

## Release Strategy

For a solo project, a staged release approach works best:

1. **Personal use** (Alpha): Use it yourself daily
2. **Closed beta**: Invite 5-10 developer friends
3. **Open beta**: Public GitHub repo with clear limitations
4. **Initial release**: Basic paid tier once stable

## Resource Allocation

| Component | Time Investment | Value Delivery |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Core Web App | 35% | High |
| tRPC API Layer | 15% | High |
| VSCode Extension | 20% | High |
| AI Processing | 15% | Medium |
| Other Extensions | 5% | Medium |
| Documentation | 10% | Medium |

## Remember

As a solo developer, your greatest advantages are:

1. **Agility**: You can pivot quickly as you learn
2. **Focus**: You can deeply understand every part of your system
3. **Ownership**: You can make decisions without committee approval
4. **Type Safety**: tRPC eliminates entire classes of bugs

Your greatest challenges will be:

1. **Time constraints**: You can't do everything
2. **Knowledge gaps**: You'll encounter unfamiliar territory
3. **Motivation**: Maintaining momentum without a team

Embrace the constraints and use them to drive focused, valuable development.
